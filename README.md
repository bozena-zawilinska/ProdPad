# ProdPad

<b>1. How did you approach the template build (Part 1)?</b>

I have created a custom page template and custom block patterns, which I then used to build most of the sections in my Tech Test Page. 
All my custom patterns can be found in the page editor, under the custom category called ProdPad.

For the Apps section I used the Bootstrap framework and the Custom HTML block. 


<b>2. What did you do to make sure your code was accessible and SEO friendly?</b>

- I added the image alt attributes to all images.
- Meta title, meta description and focus keyphrase have been added to the Tech Test Page.

<b>3. How did you compile your SASS?</b>

I used Laravel Mix to compile my SASS. The src folder contains my app.scss file which is compiled by Larvel Mix into the dist folder.

<b>4. How did you decide on your mobile layout?</b>

For mobile layout I decided to display all sections in one column.


<b>5. What issues did you encounter (if any)?</b>

I struggled to position the dots image so that it would always appear in front of the rainbow door. 


<b>6. Why did you choose the plugins you chose (if any)?</b>

I installed three plugins:
- the SVG support to be able to add svg files to the media library.
- Yoast SEO for search engine optimization
- All-in_one WP Migration to create a backup of the old site.

<b>7. Why did you make the content editable in the way you did?</b>

For most sections, I created block patterns which can be reused by other users. 

The dark blue background in the first section has been added directly in my custom page template, as I want all pages that would use this template to have the same blue background. 

<b>8. How would you communicate how to edit this new template to the Marketing team?</b>

I would use a presentation program like Google Slides to create a short tutorial, explaining step by step how to select a template and how to add block patterns to the page. 


<b>9. What would you do if you had more time?</b>

If I had more time I would like to complete the Apps section grid and try to convert it into the block pattern. I would also like to spend more time on improving the design for all devices and adding animations.
